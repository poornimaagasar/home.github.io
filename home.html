                <p>As soon as I turned 18, I donated blood for the first time in my life. I didn't have any clear idea about the procedure or what I was expected to do or in what way I was contributing. But after being a donor once, I have donated blood almost 19 times without any fail.
                    During my initial visits as a donor, the blood centre doctor and staff did their part in educating me about the shortage of blood and its impact on the needy.

                <p>Even now after all these years,I remain calm and composed when the nurse ties a tourniquet on my arm.It does not bother me when the needle is inserted into my vein and the nurse places the glass tube on the holder.Last year was the 151st time I donated blood.I have been donating blood every three months for the past 40 years.</p>
